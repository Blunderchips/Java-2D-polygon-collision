Java-2D-polygon-collision
=========================

A wrapper around the values needed for a malleable 2D polygon collision class
will detect, but not resolve, collisions. It uses an efficient data search structure to quickly find intersecting Collidable as well as offering general utilities to the Collidable.

I am currently useing this source code within a Java 2D game engine, <a href='https://github.com/Blunderchips/Dwarf2D' title='.:Dwarf2D:.'>Dwarf2D</a>.

**Watch/star to follow along with progress!**


###Use
either create a new <code>Collidable</code> or make your class extend <code>Collidable</code> to use, once you have done that you will have full acsess to the class and all its functionality.

<code>
  Collidable coll = new Collidable();
</code>

for more infomation and what each function does view the <a href='https://github.com/Blunderchips/Java-2D-polygon-collision/wiki' title='wiki'>wiki</a>.
